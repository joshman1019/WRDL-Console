# WRDL-Console
WRDL console is a variant of the popular word game Wordle. The game is a simple console application with a large word database that can be played as many times as you would like. This game was created because my coworkers wanted to play more than one round at a time.  
## Compatibility
WRDL Console is compatible with any Windows system with the .NET 6 runtime installed. 
## Contributions
WRDL Console is a working game, but it is also a work in progress. Any contributions are appreciated. 
## Future
Because this game was quickly developed, bug fixes and enhancements (such as a GUI) may be added in the future. Contributions are welcome.
